\section*{Appetizer}
Consider the following statement (a special case of Manin--Mumford):

\begin{theorem}
  Let $n > 0$ be a natural number,
  and let $\mathbb G = (\CC^*)^n$
  be the $n$-th power of the unit group of the complex numbers.
  Let $f \in \CC[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be a polynomial in $n$ variables.
  Then the set
  \[
    X = \{ (\zeta_1, \dots, \zeta_n) \in \mathbb G \mid
    \text{each $\zeta_i$ is a root of unity and $f(\zeta_1, \dots, \zeta_n) = 0$}\}
  \]
  is a finite union of cosets of subgroups of $\mathbb G$.
\end{theorem}

Originally, this statement was proven by Mann,
but we will be interested in the Pila--Zannier argument.
It goes as follows.
Observe that there is an analytic covering $\exp \colon \CC^n \to \mathbb G$.
A tuple $\zeta = (\zeta_1, \dots, \zeta_n)$ consists of roots of unity
if and only if there is some rational $a \in \QQ^n$ such that $\exp(a) = \zeta$.
This means that we can translate our problem into
a question about rational solutions to the transcendental equation $f(\exp(z)) = 0$.

It may seem as if we have made the problem a lot more difficult.
However, by restricting to a fundamental domain
\[
  D = \{ (z_1, \dots, z_n) \in \CC^n \mid 0 \le \Re(z_i) < 2\pi \text{ for each $i$}\}
\]
we end up in a \emph{tame} situation.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is again the case that $\zeta \in \mathbb G$ is a tuple of roots of unity
    if and only if there exists a \emph{rational} $a \in D \cap \QQ^n$ such that $\exp(a) = \zeta$.
  \item The restriction of~$\exp$ to~$D$ is a definable function in the structure~$\RR_{\exp}$,
    which is an \emph{o-minimal} structure.
    From the point of view of mathematical logic, this means it is exceedingly well-behaved.
\end{enumerate}

We may now consider the set
\[ \tilde X = \{ z \in D \mid f(\exp(z)) = 0 \} \]
which is an example of a \emph{definable set} in~$\RR_{\exp}$.
This is where the Pila--Wilkie point counting theorem comes in.

Understanding the rational solutions to algebraic equations is a notoriously hard problem.
But it turns out that one can get a good grip on rational solutions to \emph{transcendental} equations.

Let $Y \subset \RR^m$ be any set, definable in some o-minimal expansion of the reals.
We define the \emph{algebraic part} $Y^\alg \subset Y$ to be
the union of all connected, positive dimensional semialgebraic subsets of~$Y$.
(Recall that a set is semialgebraic if it is definable using Boolean combinations of polynomial inequalities.)
Next, we define the \emph{transcendental part} of~$Y$ to be $Y - Y^\alg$.

The Pila--Wilkie point counting theorem asserts that there are sub-exponentially many rational points in~$Y^\tra$.
To make this precise, we introduce the following function,
which counts rational points of \emph{bounded height}:
\[
  N(Y,t) = \# \{ (\tfrac{a_1}{b_1}, \dots, \tfrac{a_n}{b_n}) \in Y^\tra \mid
  \text{for each $i$ we have }
  |a_i| \le t, |b_i| \le t, a_i, b_i \in \ZZ \}
\]

\begin{theorem}[Pila--Wilkie]
  For each $\epsilon > 0$ there is a constant $C = C_\epsilon$
  so that $N(Y, t) \le Ct^\epsilon$ for all $t \ge 1$.
\end{theorem}

Now we return to our definable set of interest: $\tilde X$.
Using a result by Ax (a function field version of the Schanuel conjecture)
we can show that $\tilde X^\alg$ is indeed a finite union of cosets of subgroups
(intersected with $[0,2\pi)^n$).

Hence we are done if we show that $\tilde X^\tra$ only has finitely many rational points.
This is done by contradiction.
If there are infinitely many points,
then one can use Galois theory
to show that $N(Y, t)$ must exhibit exponential growth.
This contradicts Pila--Wilkie, so we win.
